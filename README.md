# Welcome!

The documentation is broken up into two sections **guides** and the **reference**. Guides introduce concepts related to reproducibility and actionable steps to improve your research workflow. The role of the reference is a quick lookup for a fairly terse, but informative description of a concept and its role in the reproducibility context.

To get started, read the [introduction](./introduction.md) on reproducibility, what it is and why it matters. Alternately, if you are looking for something specific, use the search box in the upper left corner. If you don't find what you are looking for please ask a question on the [community discussion site](https://discuss.rdm.academy).
