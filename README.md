# Welcome!

This is an [open, work-in-progress resource](https://github.com/rdm-academy/docs) to learn about the concepts driving [RDM Academy](https://rdm.academy) and best practices to follow to maximize reproducibility. Currently there are two formats of information in the form of guides and a general reference.

**Guides** introduce concepts related to reproducibility and best practices to follow pertaining to data management and the like.

The **reference** is a quick lookup for a fairly terse, but informative description of a concept and its role in the research data management or reproducibility context.

## Getting Started

If this is your first time here, read the [introduction](./introduction.md) on reproducibility, what it is, and why it matters.

If you are looking for something specific, use the search box in the upper left corner or browse the table of contents on the left side. If you don't find what you are looking for please ask a question on the [community discussion](https://discuss.rdm.academy)!
